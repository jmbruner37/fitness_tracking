# Fitness tracking




**Where to find files:**

* Presentation: fitness trakcing machine learning.pdf

* Machine learning classification: -> Machine Learning -> Classification

* Machine learning regression: -> Machine Learning -> Regression

* SQL Database: -> database_zhiyi -> database_creation.ipynb + fitness_database.sqlite 

* Tableau: Fitness Tracking Overview Final.twbx

* Web: index.html



**Project Questions:**


*Regression Analysis*

* Can running pace be predicted based on max pace, elevation, heart rate, temp, and athlete count?

*Classification Analysis*
 
* Do specific running features relate more to a specific time of day?

* Can we use machine learning to accurately predict the type of workout based on factors such as heart rate, start time, and length of workout?


**Workflow**

* Describe Fitness Tracking Data via Tableau

* Machine Learning Analysis

* Database Architecture using SQLite

* Frontend Design with HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
